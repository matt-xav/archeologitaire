This is a more fun take on the basic solitaire game. 
The whole game more resembles an  dig. 

At the start of the game the board is covered in dirt, 
    - The player must sweep it around the board. 
    - A card cannot be used if it is covered in dirt.

Some of the cards are “Cursed Cards”. 
    - They will invert in color and stay that way until the card gets moved around
    - When a Cursed Card is face up, they cause blindness. 
        - Blindness persists until the card is moved somewhere else. 
        - The board will be concealed in darkness 
            - Except for a specific radius around the cursor. 
		
BE CAREFUL OF HOW YOU CLICK 
   - If you click the right mouse button while the left mouse button is 
     already pressed then you will blow the card up and lose it forever.
   - There is no way to get it back once it is blown-up.
